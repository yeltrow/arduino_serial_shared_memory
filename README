	It allows you to use a simple serial protocol to read and write
	blocks of memory in the arduino using hexadecimal ascii for the
	address and the data.  This keeps it from getting poluted by
	other characters and completely agnostic of the data type and
	location it is sending it to or getting it from.  I use python
	to send an receive the data from the arduino.  It is currently
	used in my hot air heating solar panel system to post the 
	IP address of a rasberry Pi on the LCD connected to my arduino.
	It also harvests temperature data from the arduino and appends it as
	records to a CSV file.  Works well for me, YMMV.
